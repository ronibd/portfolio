            <p>I say, there is no perfect way to learn. Whatever anyone recommends, check it out. If you like it,
                continue. If you don’t like it, Google it or search on YouTube or any mobile app store and find other
                ways to learn. Once you have tried out multiple ways for a few weeks, you will find out your own way to
                learn. So, don’t try to fit hard on other’s way, instead, build your own way to learn. That way, you
                will learn better!</p>
